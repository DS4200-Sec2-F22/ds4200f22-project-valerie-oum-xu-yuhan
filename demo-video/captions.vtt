00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:12.200
The first visualization that we have to show
is a boxplot.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.000
This boxplot is showing the distribution of
rain levels for all source locations.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.369
Each source location represents where the
user is when they are ordering an uber or

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.369
lyft.

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:29.900
These locations are Back Bay, North Station,
North End, Haymarket Square, West End, Beacon

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:36.660
Hill, Financial District, Fenway, Northeastern
University, Theatre District, Boston University,

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.989
South Station.

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:40.670
All of these source locations are in Boston.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:50.300
When a user selects hovers over any one of
these boxes the quartile 1, median and quartile

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.690
3 shows for that specific locations rain level.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.500
So it essentially shows distribution.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:03.969
If a user decides to select a box, down below
the scatterplot that shows the price value

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:13.140
versus the rain level appear on the scatterplot
(instead of barchart).

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:23.250
The user can select several boxes at a time
and they all appear on the scatterplot.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:30.049
The user can also deselct.

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:40.689
. . as well.
